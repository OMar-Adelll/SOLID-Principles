# SOLID-Principles

A repository showcasing SOLID design principles with practical examples for clean and maintainable OOP.

## Principles

- [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](SRP/README.md) – A class should have only one reason to change.
- [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](OCP/README.md) – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](LSP/README.md) – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](ISP/README.md) – Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](DIP/README.md) – High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
