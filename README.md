## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
[Learn more](#) – Each class should have one reason to change.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
[Learn more](#) – Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
[Learn more](#) – Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
[Learn more](#) – Clients should not depend on interfaces they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
[Learn more](#) – High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
